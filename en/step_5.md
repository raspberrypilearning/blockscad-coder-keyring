## Alternating height

Next you'll add some interest to your badge by alternating the height of the letters. This helps to separate the letters. 

+ The letters are currently 3mm tall. 

	Change the height (thickness) of the "O" and the "E" so that they are only 2mm tall.

Tip: You can change the colour of your model in the output view by clicking on the coloured block. If you 3D print the model then the actual colour will depend on the plastic filament that you use but it's useful to be able to try out different colours.
