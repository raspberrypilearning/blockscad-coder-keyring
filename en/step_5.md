## Challenge: Create a key ring with your name

--- task ---

Create a 3D text key ring or badge with your name or another word or short phrase. 

Tips:
+ Make sure that all of the letters join up
+ Make sure that the back of your key ring is flat and even, otherwise it will be very difficult to print

Here's an example:

--- task ---

Create a key ring where the letters line up vertically instead of horizontally. 

Here's an example:

![A vertical keyring](images/coder-vertical.png)

You will need to `translate` letters along the Y axis.

Add a loop

If there isn't anywhere to add a key ring at the beginning of your word, then you could add a smaller letter 'o' to make a loop. 

Here's an example:

![The 'o' loop connected to a keyring](images/coder-loop.png)

This time, you will need to `translate` the 'o' along the X and Y axes. 

Using `-1` in the X axis will move the 'o' left.
