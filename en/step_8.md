## 3D Printing

BlocksCAD 3D can export an `.STL` file for 3D printing. 

+ Render your model and then click `Generate STL`. Remember where you save the file. 

+ There are lots of tools that can read STL files and send 3D models to a printer. 

	The one you choose will depend on the 3D printer that you are using.
