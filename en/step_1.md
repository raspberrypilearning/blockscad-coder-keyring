## Introduction

In this project you will write code to model a 3D printable "CODER" keyring. If you have access to a 3D printer then you can print it out. 

The resulting keyring doesn't use a lot of filament and is small and quick to 3D print. 

### What you will make

Add something here to showcase here, for example:

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/160619869/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

### What you will learn

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum){:target="_blank"}:

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](hhttps://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/design/creator/){:target="_blank"}

If you 3D print the model then you will also cover:

+ [Use manufacturing techniques and tools to create a completed product](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/manufacture/developer/){:target="_blank"}

Younger makers will need assistance or supervision to use a 3D printer. 

### Additional information for educators

If you need to print this project, please use the [printer-friendly version](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blockcad-coder-badge/print){:target="_blank"}.
