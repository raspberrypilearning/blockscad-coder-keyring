## What you will make

Design a 'CODER' key ring that can be 3D printed.

BlocksCAD is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a computer or tablet. You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing. 

The key ring will measure around 14mm by 50mm. 

### You will need (optional)

+ A 3D printer and filament. Solid colours work best. The key ring doesn't use a lot of filament and is small and quick to 3D print. 
+ A split ring for making the key ring. A 19mm diameter split ring works well.
