## Introduction

In this project you will use BlocksCAD to design a 3D printable "CODER" keyring.

BlocksCAD is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a desktop computer or tablet. You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing. 

If you have access to a 3D printer then you can print your keyring. The resulting keyring doesn't use a lot of filament and is small and quick to 3D print. 

### What you will make

The finished keyring looks like this:

You can put a split-ring through the gap between the C and the O to make a keyring. 

The keyring will be roughly 14mm by 50mm. 

### What you will learn

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum){:target="_blank"}:

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](hhttps://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/design/creator/){:target="_blank"}

If you 3D print the model then you will also cover:

+ [Use manufacturing techniques and tools to create a completed product](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/manufacture/developer/){:target="_blank"}

Younger makers will need assistance or supervision to use a 3D printer. 

### Additional information for educators
