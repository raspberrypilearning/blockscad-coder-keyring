## Introduction

In this project, you will use BlocksCAD to design a 'CODER' key ring that can be 3D printed.

BlocksCAD is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a computer or tablet. You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing. 

If you have access to a 3D printer, then you can print your key ring. The key ring doesn't use a lot of filament and is small and quick to 3D print. 

### What you will make

The finished key ring looks like this:

You can put a split ring through the gap between the 'C' and the 'O' to make a key ring. 

The key ring will measure around 14mm by 50mm.

### Hardware

+ A 3D printer and filament. Solid colours work best.
+ A split ring for making the key ring. A 19mm diameter split ring works well.

### Software

+ This project can be completed in a web browser using BlocksCAD [blockscad3d.com/editor/](https://www.blockscad3d.com/editor){:target="_blank"}
