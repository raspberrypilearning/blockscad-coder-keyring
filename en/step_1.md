## Introduction

In this project you will use BlocksCAD to design a 3D printable "CODER" keyring.

BlocksCAD is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a desktop computer or tablet. You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing. 

If you have access to a 3D printer then you can print your keyring. The resulting keyring doesn't use a lot of filament and is small and quick to 3D print. 

### What you will make

The finished keyring looks like this:

You can put a split-ring through the gap between the C and the O to make a keyring. 

The keyring will be roughly 14mm by 50mm.

### Hardware

+ A 3D printer and filament, solid colours work best.
+ A split ring for making a keyring. A 19mm diameter split ring works well.
