## Create 3D text

--- task ---

Open the BlocksCAD editor in a web browser [blockscad3d.com/editor/](https://www.blockscad3d.com/editor/){:target="_blank"}.

You can drag and drop blocks to write code to create 3D objects. 

--- /task ---

First, use the 3D text tool to create some 3D letters.

--- task ---

Click on `Text`{:class="blockscadtext"} and then drag a `3D Text`{:class="blockscadtext"} block onto the canvas.

Change the `3D text` input to say 'CODER'.

Click the **Render** button to see what it looks like.

Rendering is the process of creating an image from a 3D model so that we can see what it looks like.

To make the letters bigger, change the `size` to `20` â€” that means font size 20.

Click **Render** again to see the result.

If you 3D printed the model you have created now, then you would get five separate letters, because they are not joined together. That wouldn't make a very good key ring!
