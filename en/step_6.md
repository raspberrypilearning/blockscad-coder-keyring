## Challenge: Create a key ring with your name

Now, create a 3D text key ring or badge with your name or another word or short phrase. 

Tips:
+ Make sure that all the letters join up
+ Don't have letters floating in the air, as that will make your key ring harder to print

Here's an example:

## Challenge: Add a loop

If there isn't anywhere to add a key ring at the beginning of your word, then you could add a smaller letter 'o' to make a loop. 

Here's an example:
