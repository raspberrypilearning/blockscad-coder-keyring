## Challenge: Create a keyring with your name

Now create a 3D text keyring or badge with your name or another word or short phrase. 

Tips:
+ Remember to make sure all the letters join up. 
+ Don't have letters floating in the air as that will make your keyring harder to print.

Here's an example:

## Challenge: Create a keyring with vertical letters

Can you create a keyring where all the letters line up vertically instead of horizontally. 

Here's an example:

--- hints ---
--- hint ---
This time you will need to translate letters in the Y direction. 
--- /hint ---
--- /hints ---

## Challenge: Add a loop

If there's nowhere to add a keyring at the beginning of your word then you could try adding a smaller letter "o" as a loop. 

Here's an example:

--- hints ---
--- hint ---
This time you will need to translate the "o" in the X and Y directions.
