## Challenge: Create a key ring with your name

Now, create a 3D text key ring or badge with your name or another word or short phrase. 

Tips:
+ Make sure that all of the letters join up
+ Make sure that the back of your key ring is flat and even, otherwise it will be very difficult to print

Here's an example:

## Challenge: Create a key ring with vertical letters

Create a key ring where the letters line up vertically instead of horizontally. 

Here's an example:

This time, you will need to `translate` letters along the Y axis.

## Challenge: Add a loop

If there isn't anywhere to add a key ring at the beginning of your word, then you could add a smaller letter 'o' to make a loop. 

Here's an example:

--- hints ---
--- hint ---

This time, you will need to `translate` the 'o' along the X and Y axes.
