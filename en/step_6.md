## Challenge: Create a keyring with vertical letters

Can you create a keyring where all the letters line up vertically instead of horizontally. 

Here's an example:

--- hints ---
--- hint ---
This time you will need to tranlate letters in the Y direction. 
--- /hint ---
--- /hints ---

## Challenge: Add a loop

If there's nowhere to add a keyring at the beginning of your word then you could try adding a smaller letter "o" as a loop. 

Here's an example:

--- hints ---
--- hint ---
This time you will need to tranlate the "o" in the X and Y directions. 
--- /hint ---
--- /hints ---
